We are students of the Faculty of Informatics at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Madrid, Spain.

Our final degree work it's about a written HTML5 video game that teaches you to program a game in HTML5.

All thanks to the game development engine "Phaser.js" and knowledge we have acquired during these four years.
